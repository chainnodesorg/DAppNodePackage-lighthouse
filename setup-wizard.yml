    title: Execution Client Endpoint
    description: >-
      The Consensus Clients (Lighthouse, Nimbus, Prysm, and Teku) require access to an Execution Client to receive the execution payload by using the Engine API of the Execution Client. This endpoint MUST be provided for an Execution Client which is run on your own locally. IT IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE TO USE INFURA OR ANY SERVICE PROVIDER.

    title: Checkpoint for fast sync
    description: >-
      To get Lighthouse up and running in only a few minutes, you can start Lighthouse from a recent finalized checkpoint state rather than syncing from genesis. This is substantially **faster** and consumes **less resources** than syncing from genesis, while still providing all the same features.  Be sure you are using a trusted node for the fast sync. Check [Lighthouse docs](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/checkpoint-sync.html).
      Use the DAppNode official endpoint at `https://checkpoint-sync.dappnode.io/` or get your checkpoint sync from [Infura](https://infura.io/) (i.e https://XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX@eth2-beacon-chain.infura.io)

    description: >-
      Fee Recipient is a feature that lets you specify a priority fee recipient address on your validator client instance and beacon node. After The Merge, execution clients will begin depositing priority fees into this address whenever your validator client proposes a new block.
